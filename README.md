**Build real-time multi-model applications at any scale with Redis**

## What is this book about?
In modern applications, efficiency in both operational and analytical aspects is paramount, demanding predictable performance across varied workloads. This book introduces you to Redis Stack, an extension of Redis and guides you through its broad data modeling capabilities. With practical examples of real-time queries and searches, you’ll explore Redis Stack’s new approach to providing a rich data modeling experience all within the same database server.

* This book covers the following exciting features:
* Get started with data modeling using JSON and hash documents, vectors, and time series
* Implement microservices patterns and resolve typical use cases
* Use probabilistic data structures to analyze datasets and streams
* Integrate Redis Stack into your Java, Python, C#, Golang, and Node.js projects
* Develop powerful data flows using triggers and stream processing features
* Manage your database server for scalability, high availability, and security
* Visualize and manage your data with RedisInsight

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter04.

The code will look like the following:
```
client = redis.Redis(host='127.0.0.1', port=6379,

username='<YOUR_USERNAME>',

password='<YOUR_PASSWORD>')

client.set("Redis", "Stack")

print(client.get("Redis"))
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for database administrators, database developers, software developers, and software architects who want to discover the powerful real-time, multi-model capabilities of the Redis Stack database. A basic understanding of Redis and databases in general, coupled with software development skills in at least one of Java, Python, C#, Golang, or JavaScript languages will help you understand the concepts covered in this book.
